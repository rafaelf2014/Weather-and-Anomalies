Here's a little explanation about the program.

1. When opening it will ask for a place, it will only accept valid cities and it's not case sensitive.

2. After inserting a valid city it will direct you to the weather for the day nothing special there.

3. In the side bar we can see various button, 1 of them is the "weekly" button, this will show you the forecast for the next 5 days
it will also come with the option of creating graphs of temperature, humidity, pressure and win, for that just use the dropdown
menu, choose an option and click "graph".

4. In the side bar there is also an "history" and "change recording" buttons this functions allows you to choose a city to track
once a city is choosen, once a day or once every 3 hours* it will register all the weather data of that place in a file, clicking
the "history" button will open the file, also, it's safe to close the program, it will justo go into the background and continue
to register the weather. *the 3 hours options is still not implemented in the interface and can only be choosen from the code for now.

5. The next button is the "notifications" button, once you click it it's pretty apparent just type you email and the app will check
the disaster probability in the city you're currently tracking, if the chance ever becomes critical >50% you will be sent an email.

6. The las button you can see is just to change between dark and light modes.

Enjoy! Preferably in dark mode, the light mode is kinda ugly.
